# Maintenance Checker

## Introduction

This app would be designed with the sole intent to keep your car up to date from everything to an oil change to getting new control arms. It would help remind you of even the simple things and help even the most cluttered person remember to take good care of their car. On top of this, it would also help locate the most reliable mechanics in your nearby area using the revolutionary technology of google maps. With this app we'll make sure your car and everyone else's can keep their car reliable and safe. 

### Intended users

* People who are always busy and have trouble remembering to maintain their car

    > As someone who is constantly busy and forgets some of the crucial aspects of maintaining a car and I want to have a reminder so that my car can always stay in its current, reliable state. 

* People who want to be sure they have the most reliable service 

    > As someone who has been ripped off by the mechanic before it's important to me that I am going to the most reliable place in town so that it does not happen again.

### Functionality

* People will put in their location, so the app knows what mechanics are close by 
* After this people will then put in their car information along with the date it last had maintenance 
* Following this the app works like a scheduling app by having green, yellow, and red backgrounds which signify when to go and back to the shop. Green meaning up-to-date, yellow meaning near check up time, red meaning it has time has expired, and it should be checked up.  
* There will be an add button under all the items where the user can add information about a new type of maintenance on their car.
* Under the add button there will be a map button which shows the user the mechanics nearby and their respective reviews.
* By clicking on the mechanic/mechanic shop it will list reviews. 

### Persistent data

* Car maintenance types 
* Maintenance dates
    
### Device/external services
